    <h1>Welcome to the Despicable Website!</h1>
    <p>yay! this is a websit all about puppies. puppies r sooooo cute and fluffy. they have fur and waggy tails. sometimes they bark like woof woof! 🐶🐾</p>
    <p>puppies come in different colors, like brown and white and black. they have big round eyes that sparkle. they love to play and run around. i like playing fetch with my puppy, it's fun!</p>
    <p>did u know puppies need food and water? they eat from bowls and drink from little dishes. it's important to take care of them. they also need love and cuddles. cuddles make them happy. 🥰</p>
    <p>puppies grow up to be big dogs someday. but even when they're big, they're still cute. they protect us and make us feel safe. they're our best friends.</p>
    <p>i hope u enjoyed learning about puppies. they're the bestest! bye bye now! 👋😄</p>
