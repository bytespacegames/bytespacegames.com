leave me alone google.

update in june of 2022

we still don't knowingly collect data but googles harassing me again so i will say, our games sometimes use third party software for advertising. these likely collect your data for advertising purposes and we will never knowingly allow someone to harmfully collect ur data

is that engough google

septembre:
ok well apparentl;y it wasnt enough. thanks google for harrassing me in every way

our games rely on services such as unity and unity ads to display content and to publis hthe stuff
unity ads may collect your data for advertising
unity may pick up on data about ur device
we're not doing this garbage, thats unity, read their privacy policy, wherever that is, i really do not care. its not us, its them, and by using our garbage apps, theyre prolly collecting ur stuff, sooooo go read their policy bruv. anyways ye, ok google, its not me, its them, and i stated that users should read their policy so ill say this another time

LEAV E ME ALOOOOOOOOOONE
